In Problem Set 7 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science, the student is asked to implement a site on which users can play a stock buying/selling game, using real-time stock prices.

Some of this project's code was provided by CS50 staff. The following code is my own:

1. All the code in application.py, starting with '@app.route("/")' until (not including) 'def errorhandler(e):'
2. All the HTML to render all this functionality to the user, except apology.html and login.html
